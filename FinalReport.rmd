# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

Is attitude toward capitol punishment (CAPPUN) independent of race (RACE)?
If not, then whose view differs from whom??

$H_0$:One's attitude torwards capital punishment is independent of race.  


$H_A$:One's attitude torwards capital punishment is dependent of race.  


# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

The data in this study is attitude torwards capital punishment and the race of the individual.
Both these variabales are considered categorical.

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->

```{r}
dd2 <- GSS %>% group_by(RACE,CAPPUN) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% mutate(prcnt=count/sum(count))

basicC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=RACE,y=count,fill=CAPPUN))
basicC + geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")
#Now for percentage plot

basicCC <- ggplot(dd2,aes(x=RACE,y=prcnt*100,fill=CAPPUN)) 
basicCC + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
```

White's and other races favor capital punishment while Black's opposes capital punishment.

### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~RACE + CAPPUN, data=GSS)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```

More than 65% of whites and other races favor capital punishment.

More then 65% of blacks oppose capital punishment.

It appears that there is a correlation between attitude towards capital punishment and race.

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
```{r}
fisherXY = function(x, y, confL = 0, printAll=FALSE){
  # Inputs: 
  #   x: factor variable, 2 levels
  #   y: factor variable, n levels
  # confL: confidence level, default = 0.95
  #        print only those tables, results if p-value < (1-confL)
  # printAll: overide the 'print only if p-value < (1-confL), and
  #           print all tables and fisher test results
  #
  # Constraint:
  #   x and y must be same length
  #
  # Outputs:
  #   All 2x2 Fisher exact tests
  
  if(confL<0 || confL> 1){
    print('error: confL must be between 0 and 1')
    return(999)
  }
  
  if(!is.factor(x)) x=as.factor(x)
  if(!is.factor(y)) y=as.factor(y)
  
  fisherTable = as.matrix(table(x, y))
  cat('\ncontingency table:\n')
  print(fisherTable)
  cat('\n***All 2X2 tests****\n\n')

  # all 2x2 tests
  levelsY = levels(y)
  levelsX = levels(x)
  
  m = length(levelsX)
  n = length(levelsY)
  
  confLevel = 0.95
  if (confL !=0 ) confLevel=confL
  
  for (i in 1:(m-1))
       for(j in ((i+1):m))
          for (k in 1:(n-1))
             for (l in ((k+1):n)) {
                
                 fisherIndexX = c(i,j)
                 fisherIndexY = c(k,l)
                 
                 fTempTable = as.matrix(fisherTable[fisherIndexX,
                                        fisherIndexY])
                 
                 fisherTest=fisher.test(fTempTable, conf.int = TRUE, 
                              conf.level = confLevel)
                 
                 if((fisherTest$p.value < (1-confLevel) ) || printAll){
                   
                       print(c(levelsX[i], levelsX[j]))
                       print(c(levelsY[k], levelsY[l]))
                       print(fTempTable)
                       print(fisherTest)
                       cat('\n')
                 }
                 
        }
}

```
```{r}
fisherXY(GSS$CAPPUN,GSS$RACE,printAll = T)
```
The P value of 0.2751 suggest that there very little difference between other races and whites ,as both favor capital punishment....white and others both favor capital punishment.  

The P value of 0.001598 suggests that race and attitude toward capital punishment is related there for we reject the Null hypothesis. Blacks oppose capital punishment while whites favor capital punishment



# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
